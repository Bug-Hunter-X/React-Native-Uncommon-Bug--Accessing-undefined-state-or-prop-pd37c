This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been assigned a value.  This often happens when a component renders before the data it needs has been fetched from an API or passed down from a parent component.  The error message might vary depending on the specific context, but it generally indicates that you are trying to use 'undefined' or 'null' as if it were an object with properties.
